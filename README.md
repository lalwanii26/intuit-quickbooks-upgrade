This case is a “classic” in more ways than one. The key event, the release of version 3 of the QuickBooks software, takes place in 1995. Although ecommerce was already feasible in 1991, at the time of the case, QuickBooks products could only be purchased through Intuit Direct (i.e., delivery by mail) or through “brick-and-mortar” retailers like Best Buy.

The purpose is to gain experience modeling the response to an upsell campaign. The intuit75k.rds file contains data on 75,000 (small) businesses selected randomly from the 801,821 that were sent the wave-1 mailing.1 The mailing contained an offer to upgrade to the latest version of the QuickBooks software.

Variable “res1” denotes which of these businesses responded to the mailing by purchasing QuickBooks version 3.0 from Intuit Direct. Note that Intuit Direct sells products directly to its customers rather than through a brick-and-mortar retailer like Best Buy. Use the available data to predict which businesses that did not respond to the wave-1 mailing, are most likely to respond to the wave-2 mailing. Use the variable descriptions in the intuit75k.rds file and in the table below:
